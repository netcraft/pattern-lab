## About the PHP Version of Pattern Lab

The PHP version of Pattern Lab is, at its core, a static site generator. It combines platform-agnostic assets, like the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-based patterns and the JavaScript-based viewer, with a PHP-based "builder" that transforms and dynamically builds the Pattern Lab site. By making it a static site generator, the PHP version of Pattern Lab strongly separates patterns, data, and presentation from build logic. The PHP version should be seen as a reference for other developers to improve upon as they build their own Pattern Lab Builders in their language of choice.

## Demo

You can play with a demo of the front-end of the PHP version of Pattern Lab at [demo.pattern-lab.info](http://demo.pattern-lab.info).

## Getting Started

The PHP version of Pattern Lab should be relatively easy for anyone to get up and running.

## Working with Patterns

Patterns are the core element of Pattern Lab. Understanding how they work is the key to getting the most out of the system. Patterns use [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) so please read [Mustache's docs](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) as well.

## Creating & Working With Dynamic Data for a Pattern

The PHP version of Pattern Lab utilizes Mustache as the template language for patterns. In addition to allowing for the [inclusion of one pattern within another](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php/wiki/Including-One-Pattern-Within-Another) it also gives pattern developers the ability to include variables. This means that attributes like image sources can be centralized in one file for easy modification across one or more patterns. The PHP version of Pattern Lab uses a JSON file, `source/_data/data.json`, to centralize many of these attributes.

## Using Pattern Lab's Advanced Features

By default, the Pattern Lab assets can be manually generated and the Pattern Lab site manually refreshed but who wants to waste time doing that? Here are some ways that the PHP version of Pattern Lab can make your development workflow a little smoother:
